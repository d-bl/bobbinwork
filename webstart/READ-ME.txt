buid.xml generates pairs of build/*.jnlp and build/*.jar files
with a specified revision number
  
The committed files webstart/*.jnlp
should point to the last uploaded jar files.
The following procedure achieves that.

The file ant.properties in a directory above the project
can set the value of svn.revision.of.published.jar 
Set this value to the last revision number 
in your local copy of the project.
Thus the revision number of the jar file 
will reflect the sources it was built from. 

upload the jar file(s) and test 
if OK
  Move the generated jnlp file(s) to the webstart directory and commit.
  The revision number of the jnlp file thus will always be higher than
  the jar file it launches.
otherwise
  Fix the problem, commit the fix and repeat the procedure. 
  File upload requires a higher revision number in ant.properties,
  this is provided by the committed fix.
