#summary Calculations for twist marks
#labels Phase-Implementation

By conventions lace makers mark twists in pair diagrams with short perpendicular lines. In our application this line goes approximately through the centre of a pair segment.

The figures below inspired the approximation (no need to be exact) of `t`. The final calculation can be found in the method [http://code.google.com/p/bobbinwork/source/browse/trunk/src/nl/BobbinWork/diagram/math/Annotations.java createTwistMark]. The black figures are adapted screen shots from the interactive pages of [http://www.ablestable.com/play/bezier/ AbleStable], follow the link to _Understanding Bezier Curves_

The basic idea for calculation: the ratio of the distances of the end points to both control points. Just `r1/(r1+r4)` is too simple as thus the direction would play no role.
