Users can go to the [http://code.google.com/p/bobbinwork/ project home page] and look under "links".

= Developers =
Developers may use any IDE or whatever they are comfortable with. 
The project builds with Java 1.5+ Ant 1.7.0 and JUnit 4.3 though JUnit 4.5 is recommended. For the proper JUnit version in Eclipse see this [http://www.nabble.com/Eclipse-Plugin-update--td24606794.html conversation]. 

How everything once used to work with Eclipse is described step by step on an [http://code.google.com/p/bobbinwork/source/browse/wiki/GetStarted.wiki?r=196 old version] of this page. The optional [http://www.eclemma.org/ EclEmma] plug-in for Eclipse can show you which code is touched by tests or manual execution of the code.

== Project structure ==

The project is moving from Ant to at least a Maven like organisation.

Standard are `trunk`, `branches`, `tags` and `wiki` 

The first [http://code.google.com/p/bobbinwork/source/browse/trunk/doc/class-diagrams.htm diagram] gives a birds-eye overview of the most important objects and packages. The second is not entirely accurate but easier to access than the javadoc package tree view combines with the eclipse class outline view.

|| `trunk/src/main/java` || has the executable main classes: <br>`nl.BobbinWork.diagram.gui.BwDiagrams`<br> `nl.BobbinWork.grids.GridGUI.PolarGridPrinter` ||
|| `trunk/src/main/test` || contains tests for JUnit4 ||
|| `trunk/webstart` || files generated by `build.xml` under `build` and manually moved here after uploading the corresponding jar, should probably move somehow to `generated`. ||
|| `trunk/bin` || generated by eclipse ||
|| `trunk/build` || generated by `build.xml` ||
|| `wiki/diagrams` || xml files, input for the application, note that the wiki has [LicenceIssues another license] than the code ||
|| `wiki/images` || images on the wiki page ||
|| `generated/api` ||  javadoc generated by `build.xml` ||
|| `dev-utils` || (development utilities) for third party software used by `build.xml`, see its [http://code.google.com/p/bobbinwork/source/browse/dev-utils/README.TXT readme] ||
