Users can go to the [http://code.google.com/p/bobbinwork/ project home page] and look under "links".

= Developers =
Developers may use any IDE or whatever they are comfortable with. 
The project builds with Java 1.5+ Ant 1.7.0 and JUnit 4.3 though JUnit 4.5 is recommended. For the proper JUnit version in Eclipse see this [http://www.nabble.com/Eclipse-Plugin-update--td24606794.html conversation]. 

How everything once used to work with Eclipse is described step by step on an [http://code.google.com/p/bobbinwork/source/browse/wiki/GetStarted.wiki?r=196 old version] of this page. The optional [http://www.eclemma.org/ EclEmma] plug-in for Eclipse can show you which code is touched by tests or manual execution of the code.

== Project structure ==

Though the project is Ant based, it has a Maven like organisation. Standard are `trunk`, `branches`, `tags` and `wiki`, below a project specific overview

|| <pre>trunk/src/main/java</pre> || has the executable main classes: <br>`nl.BobbinWork.diagram.gui.BwDiagrams`<br> `nl.BobbinWork.grids.GridGUI.PolarGridPrinter` ||
|| <pre>trunk/src/test/java</pre> || contains tests for JUnit4, depends on `wiki/diagrams` ||
|| `trunk/webstart` || files generated by `build.xml` in `trunk/build` and manually moved here after uploading the corresponding jar, should probably move somehow to `generated`. ||
|| `trunk/bin` || generated by eclipse ||
|| `trunk/build` || generated by `build.xml` ||
|| `trunk/doc` || documentation that should have the code license, not the wiki license.<br> The first [http://code.google.com/p/bobbinwork/source/browse/trunk/doc/class-diagrams.htm diagram] gives a birds-eye overview of the interaction between the most important objects in the 3 most important packages. The class tree is not entirely accurate but it fits on one sheet, the alternative is the javadoc [http://bobbinwork.googlecode.com/svn/generated/api/nl/BobbinWork/diagram/model/package-tree.html package tree] and perhaps the class outline views of eclipse, way too much for one sheet. See also [http://bobbinwork.googlecode.com/svn/generated/api/nl/BobbinWork/diagram/model/package-tree.html tree] for all packages. ||
|| `wiki/diagrams` || xml files, used by `ValidationTest`.<br>Input for the application, therefore under the wiki license. See LicenceIssues ||
|| `wiki/images` || images on the wiki page ||
|| `generated/api` ||  javadoc generated by `build.xml` ||
|| `dev-utils` || (development utilities) for third party software used by `build.xml` ||
