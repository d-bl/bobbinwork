*Users* can go to the [http://code.google.com/p/bobbinwork/ project home page] and look under "links".

*Developers* may use any IDE or whatever they are comfortable with. 
For testing and building you'll need Ant ant JUnit 4.5+ for the latter see this [http://www.nabble.com/Eclipse-Plugin-update--td24606794.html conversation]. 
How it once used to work with Eclipse is described step by step on an [http://code.google.com/p/bobbinwork/source/browse/wiki/GetStarted.wiki?r=196 old version] of this page.
The optional [http://www.eclemma.org/ EclEmma] plug-in for Eclipse can show you which code is touched by tests or manual execution of the code.

To become a project member or start contributing, drop a line or post patches on the [http://groups.google.com/group/bobbinwork discussion group] of the project. 
 
= Project structure =
Except for the standard `trunk`, `branches`, `tags` and `wiki` the !SubVersion repository  also has 
  * `generated` for documentation generated by the Ant file `build.xml`.
  * `dev-utils` (development utilities) for third party software used by build.xml, see its [http://code.google.com/p/bobbinwork/source/browse/dev-utils/README.TXT readme]
The wiki not only contains the actual wiki-pages, and images displayed on the wiki-pages. For [LicenceIssues license reasons] the wiki also contains sample diagrams accessible via the menu's of the application.

The project is moving from Ant to at least a Maven like organisation but the resources are not yet separated from the java sources. That requires some rework to read the built-in xml samples and keep that working not only when packaged in a Jar but also when launching directly within Eclipse.

`src/main/java`
  has the main classes:
  * `nl.BobbinWork.viewer.gui.BWViewer`
  * `nl.BobbinWork.grids.GridGUI.PolarGridPrinter`
`src/main/test`
  contains tests for JUnit4
`webstart` + `build`
  Files generated by `build.xml` that are ignored by !SubVersion, 
  I guess `webstart` should move somehow to `generated`.

The Ant file `build.xml` packages the main classes in jar files together with just what they need to run.
