= Developers =
Developers may use any IDE or whatever they are comfortable with. 
The project builds with Java 1.5+ Ant 1.7.0 and JUnit 4.3 though JUnit 4.5 is recommended. For the proper JUnit version in Eclipse see this [http://www.nabble.com/Eclipse-Plugin-update--td24606794.html conversation]. 

How everything once used to work with Eclipse is described step by step on an [http://code.google.com/p/bobbinwork/source/browse/wiki/GetStarted.wiki?r=196 old version] of this page. The optional [http://www.eclemma.org/ EclEmma] plug-in for Eclipse can show you which code is touched by tests or manual execution of the code.

== Project structure ==

The project is moving from Ant to at least a Maven like organisation.

Standard are `trunk`, `branches`, `tags` and `wiki` 

The Ant file `build.xml` packages the main classes in jar files together with just what they need to run.

`trunk/src/main/java` has the executable main classes:
  * `nl.BobbinWork.diagram.gui.BwDiagrams`
  * `nl.BobbinWork.grids.GridGUI.PolarGridPrinter`
`trunk/src/main/test`
  contains tests for JUnit4
`trunk/webstart`
  Files generated by `build.xml` that are ignored by !SubVersion, should probably move somehow to `generated`.
`trunk/bin`
  generated by eclipse
`trunk/build`
  generated by `build.xml`
`wiki/diagrams`
  xml files, input for the application, note that the wiki has another license than the code
`wiki/images`
  images on the wiki page
`generated/api`
  JavaDoc generated by `build.xml`
`dev-utils`
  (development utilities) for third party software used by build.xml, see its [http://code.google.com/p/bobbinwork/source/browse/dev-utils/README.TXT readme]
