#summary some notes on what could/should be done
#labels Phase-Requirements

  * complete the Java doc (use an alternative for the Visio diagrams?)
  * add unit tests, the package `diagram.math` is pretty complete, next would be `diagram.model`. Otherwise only high level tests are available by visually checking and manipulating the sample/ground diagrams
  * identify performance bottle necks. On Windows XP SP2 with 0.5 MB memory it take 10-20 seconds to refresh a diagram. [http://code.google.com/p/bobbinwork/source/browse/trunk/src/nl/BobbinWork/diagram/xml/expand/TreeExpander.java expand()] might not be the only problem.
  * code review
