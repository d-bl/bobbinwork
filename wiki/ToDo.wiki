  * resolve [http://groups.google.com/group/google-code-hosting/browse_thread/thread/c29b04d10111ab26 this issue] for sample diagrams/templates
  * enforce some Contributor License Agreement ?
  * see [Launching] - desired deployment
  * complete the Java doc (include the Visio diagrams?)
  * unit tests, currently only high level tests are available by visually checking and manipulating the sample diagrams
  * code reviews
  * project management
  * see also the to do's in the code and see the wish lists in the [http://bw-en.wikispaces.com/ user guide]
  * Redesign the GUI from scratch. Perhaps something like the outline view in Eclipse that synchronises with the source. Ultimately: support drawing with drag-and-drop and all types of grids on a canvas.
