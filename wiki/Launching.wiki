===Open Source distribution===
See the downloads or the [http://bw-en.wikispaces.com/ user guide wiki]

===Last Distribution with a restrictive license===
  * working diagrams: as an [http://www.xs4all.nl/%7Efalkink/BobbinWork/bwViewer.jar application] or as an [http://www.xs4all.nl/%7Efalkink/BobbinWork/viewer-EN.html applet]
  * polar grids: as an [http://www.xs4all.nl/%7Efalkink/BobbinWork/bwpGrid.jar application]

==Desired Deployment==
An environment independent build file is not yet created.

Both programs can have a language code as optional command line argument, see also the [http://bw-en.wikispaces.com/ user guide wiki].

bwpGrid.jar
  * can exclude diagram, viewer, math packages
  * main class: nl.!BobbinWork.grids.GridGUI.!PolarGridPrinter
bwViewer.jar
  * can exclude grids packages
  * main class: nl.!BobbinWork.viewer.gui.BWVApplet (executable as an applet and as an application, takes a while to launch or load a diagram)

Use Java !WebStart to make it also easily accessible for the many less computer literate lace makers who's system doesn't meet the prerequisites to execute the jar files. It should simplify the section "launching problems" on the main page of the [http://bw-en.wikispaces.com/ user guide wiki].
